This is a test document for testing the document upload functionality in ITICO.

The document upload feature allows users to:
1. Select a contraparte from the dropdown
2. Choose a document type
3. Upload a file
4. Add optional description and dates
5. Save the document to the system

This test verifies that the upload process works correctly without causing broken pipe errors.
